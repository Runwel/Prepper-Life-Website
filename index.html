                    <p>A prepper is a person who takes steps to prepare for emergencies or disasters. This may include
                        stockpiling food and supplies, learning survival skills, and creating a plan for how to respond
                        to various emergency situations. Preppers often focus on being self-sufficient and independent,
                        with the goal of being able to take care of themselves and their families in the event of a
                        disaster or other emergency. <br><br>Having a knowledge of basic first aid skills could save
                        someone’s life or your own life. These skills are easy to learn and recall in emergency
                        situations. Basic skills like CPR, setting a splint, stopping bleeding in dire situations, are
                        important life skills. Here are some basic tips from Prepper Life.</p>

                                        to stop the bleeding. The injured person could be bleeding from a main artery or
                                        vein, in which case they could bleed out in 10-15 minutes. Stopping the bleeding
                                        could be a matter of life or death. Learning how to make a tourniquet is simple

                            <p class="fs-5">A prepper is a person who takes steps to prepare for emergencies or
                                disasters. This may include stockpiling food and supplies, learning survival skills, and
                                creating a plan for how to respond to various emergency situations. Preppers often focus
                                on being self-sufficient and independent, with the goal of being able to take care of
                                themselves and their families in the event of a disaster or other emergency.
