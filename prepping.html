                <h1>Learn the Basics</h1>
                <p>Learning the basics of survival is crucial for anyone who spends time in the wilderness or in
                    emergency situations. Whether you're a hiker, camper, or just someone who wants to be prepared for
                    the unexpected, understanding the fundamentals of survival can mean the difference between life and
                    death. In this article, we'll explore the key concepts and skills that every survivalist should
                    know. From finding shelter and sourcing food and water, to signaling for help and navigating the
                    wilderness, we'll cover the essential knowledge and techniques for staying alive in a survival
                    situation. With the information and strategies outlined in this article, you'll be equipped with the
                    tools you need to handle any survival situation with confidence. So, whether you're a seasoned
                    outdoorsman or just starting to explore the world of survival, read on to learn the basics of
                    survival.</p>
                <hr class="hr" id="HM">
                <h1>Heimlich Maneuver</h1>
                <p>The Heimlich maneuver, named after its developer Henry Heimlich, is an emergency treatment for a
                    person consistent of choking on a foreign object. It involves the rescuer pressing their fists,
                    perhaps with assistance of their other hand, into the abdomen of the victim to dislodge the object.
                    It is important for anyone attempting the maneuver to be educated on the proper and improper
                    execution of this procedure. According to the National Institutes of Health, it is important for the
                    individual performing the maneuver to not press or push too hard or too soft, nor utilize the
                    Heimlich with a pregnant woman or child under the age of one (“Choking”). Additionally, a person
                    should never perform the Heimlich on a conscious person who is not choking and instead contact 911
                    or the professional medical help in the area (“Call 911”).</p><br>
                <h4>Before performing the Heimlich maneuver on someone who is choking, it's important to first assess
                    the situation and make sure that the person is actually choking. Signs of choking may include
                    difficulty breathing, coughing, and making a choking sound.</h4><br>
                <ul>
                    <li>If you suspect that someone is choking, ask them if they are okay and if they can speak. If they
                        are able to speak, encourage them to cough to try to remove the object on their own. If the
                        person is unable to speak or if their coughing is not effective at removing the object, it may
                        be necessary to perform the Heimlich maneuver.</li><br>
                    <li>Before performing the Heimlich maneuver, it's also important to make sure that you are in a safe
                        location where you have enough space to stand behind the person and wrap your arms around their
                        waist. If you are in a crowded or confined space, you may need to move the person to a safer
                        location before attempting the maneuver.</li><br>
                    <li>Finally, it's important to remain calm and try to reassure the person who is choking. Stay with
                        them and offer support until help arrives or the object is successfully removed.</li>
                </ul><br>
                <h4>The steps for performing the Heimlich maneuver are generally the same for adults, children, and
                    infants, with a few slight modifications based on the size and strength of the person being treated.
                    Here are the steps for performing the Heimlich maneuver on different types of individuals:</h4><br>
                <h2>For Adults</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>Stand behind the person who is choking and wrap your arms around their waist.</li>
                    <li>Make a fist with one hand and place it just above their belly button.</li>
                    <li>Grasp your fist with your other hand and give quick, upward thrusts into their abdomen.</li>
                    <li>Continue giving thrusts until the object is expelled or the person becomes unconscious.</li>
                    <li>If the person becomes unconscious, call 911 and begin CPR.</li>
                </ol><br>
                <h2>For Children</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>Stand behind the child who is choking and wrap your arms around their waist.</li>
                    <li>Make a fist with one hand and place it just above their belly button.</li>
                    <li>Grasp your fist with your other hand and give quick, upward thrusts into their abdomen.</li>
                    <li>For children under the age of 1, you may need to use two fingers instead of a fist to give the
                        thrusts.</li>
                    <li>Continue giving thrusts until the object is expelled or the child becomes unconscious.</li>
                    <li>If the child becomes unconscious, call 911 and begin CPR.</li>
                </ol><br>
                <h2>For Infants</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>Lay the infant face down on your forearm, with their head lower than their chest.</li>
                    <li>Support the infant's head and neck with your hand.</li>
                    <li>Using the heel of your hand, give five quick, downward thrusts between the infant's shoulder
                        blades.</li>
                    <li>If the object is not expelled, turn the infant over and give five chest thrusts by pressing down
                        on the breastbone with two fingers.</li>
                    <li>If the infant becomes unconscious, call 911 and begin CPR.</li>
                </ol><br>
                <h4><span>NOTE:</span>It's important to note that the Heimlich maneuver should only
                    be used on a conscious person. If the person is unconscious, you should call 911 and begin CPR. It's
                    also important to seek medical attention after the Heimlich maneuver is performed, as the foreign
                    object may have caused damage to the throat or windpipe.</h4><br>

                <h1>CPR(Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation)</h1>
                <p>Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) is a lifesaving technique used in emergencies to provide vital
                    oxygen to the brain and heart when someone has stopped breathing (American Red Cross). It consists
                    of two parts: chest compressions, which force the oxygen-rich blood through the person’s body and
                    mouth-to-mouth breathing which delivers oxygen directly into their lungs. The American Heart
                    Association recommends doing 30 chest compressions, followed by two breaths, and repeating until
                    medical help is present or the person is revived (“CPR: Basic Steps”). It is important to remember
                    to keep the chest compressions regular and even because this ensures the best chance of a full
                    recovery (American Red Cross). </p><br>

                <h4>Here are the steps for performing the CPR(Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation) on different types of
                    individuals:</h4><br>
                <h4>To perform CPR on an adult:</h4><br>
                <ol>
                    <li>Check for signs of life. Tap the person on the shoulder and ask if they are okay. If they do not
                        respond, call 911 or your local emergency number.</li>
                    <li>Place the person on their back on a flat surface. Kneel down next to their chest.</li>
                    <li>Place the heel of one hand on the center of the person's chest, and place your other hand on top
                        of the first hand. Interlock your fingers and keep your arms straight.</li>
                    <li>Press down on the chest with your upper body weight, using your arms and shoulders to give
                        compressions. Give 30 compressions at a rate of 100 to 120 per minute.</li>
                    <li>Open the person's airway by tilting their head back and lifting their chin. Pinch their nose
                        shut and give two breaths into their mouth, making sure to give each breath for about one
                        second.</li>
                    <li>Repeat the compressions and breaths until emergency medical services arrive or the person begins
                        to show signs of life.</li>
                </ol><br>
                <h4>To perform CPR on a child:</h4>
                <ol>
                    <li>Follow steps 1 and 2 as above.</li>
                    <li>Use one hand to give compressions on the child's chest. The compressions should be shallower and
                        at a rate of at least 100 per minute.</li>
                    <li>Follow steps 5 and 6 as above, using only one breath for each set of compressions.</li>
                </ol><br>
                <h4>To perform CPR on an infant:</h4>
                <ol>
                    <li>Follow steps 1 and 2 as above.</li>
                    <li>Place two fingers on the center of the infant's chest and give 30 compressions at a rate of at
                        least 100 per minute.</li>
                    <li>Follow steps 5 and 6 as above, using only one breath for each set of compressions.</li>
                </ol><br>
                <h4><span>NOTE:</span>It is important to remember that CPR should only be performed
                    if the person is unresponsive and not breathing or not breathing normally. If you are not trained in
                    CPR or feel uncomfortable performing it, you can still help by calling 911 and following their
                    instructions.</h4><br>

                <h1>Setting a Splint</h1>
                <p>Setting a splint is an important first aid skill to have, both to help others and yourself. Knowing
                    how to do it properly and safely can help you to prevent further damage and speed up the healing
                    process for an injured limb. It's important to remember to secure the splint close to the affected
                    joint, use padding and never force a joint against the splint or bind it too tightly. With the
                    knowledge of setting a splint, you can be prepared for any first aid situation and help provide the
                    best possible care.</p><br>
                <p>A splint is a device used to immobilize a body part, such as a finger, hand, arm, or leg. It is
                    typically used to help support and protect an injured or fractured body part while it heals. Here
                    are the steps for setting a splint:</p><br>
                <h4>To set a splint, you will need the following materials:</h4>
                <ol>
                    <li>A splint: This can be a wooden board, cardboard, or rolled newspaper, or any other flat, rigid
                        material that is long enough to extend beyond the joint above and below the injury.</li><br>
                    <li>Padding: This can be a pillow, towels, or any other soft, flexible material that can be used to
                        protect the injured body part from the hard surface of the splint.</li><br>
                    <li>Adhesive tape or bandages: These will be used to secure the splint in place. Adhesive tape or
                        cohesive wrap (such as Coban or Vetwrap) can be used, or you can use bandages, such as gauze or
                        elastic wrap.</li><br>
                </ol><br>
                <h4>It is a good idea to keep a basic first aid kit on hand, which should include these and other
                    supplies, in case you need to set a splint or treat other injuries.</h4><br>
                <h4>Here are the steps for setting a splint:</h4>
                <ol>
                    <li>Gather the necessary materials: You will need a splint (such as a wooden board, cardboard, or
                        rolled newspaper), padding (such as a pillow or towels), and adhesive tape or bandages. It is a
                        good idea to keep a basic first aid kit on hand, which should include these and other supplies.
                    </li><br>
                    <li>Position the splint: Place the splint alongside the injured body part, positioning it so that it
                        provides support and immobilization. Make sure the splint is long enough to extend beyond the
                        joint above and below the injury. For example, if you are splinting a broken finger, the splint
                        should extend from the base of the finger to the joint above the injury (e.g., the
                        metacarpophalangeal joint). If the splint is too short, it will not provide adequate support and
                        may not immobilize the injury properly.</li><br>
                    <li>Add padding: Place padding around the injured body part to protect it from the hard surface of
                        the splint. This can help prevent pressure sores or other injuries caused by the splint rubbing
                        against the skin. You can use a pillow, towels, or any other soft, flexible material for
                        padding.</li><br>
                    <li>Secure the splint: Use adhesive tape or bandages to secure the splint in place. Be sure to wrap
                        the tape or bandages snugly, but not so tightly that it cuts off circulation. If you are using
                        tape, be careful not to wrap it too tightly around the injured body part. If you are using
                        bandages, make sure they are not twisted or bunched up, as this can cause pressure on the skin
                        and disrupt circulation.</li><br>
                    <li>Check for circulation: After the splint is in place, check the injured body part for circulation
                        by lightly pressing on the fingers or toes. They should turn white, then quickly return to their
                        normal color. If they do not, the splint may be too tight and should be loosened slightly. You
                        can also check for circulation by feeling for a pulse or by looking for signs of color and
                        warmth in the injured body part.</li>
                </ol><br>
                <h4><span class="links">NOTE:</span>It is important to remember that a splint is only a temporary
                    measure to support and immobilize an injury. It is not a substitute for medical care. If you suspect
                    a fracture or serious injury, you should seek medical attention as soon as possible. A doctor or
                    other medical professional can properly diagnose and treat the injury, and may recommend a different
                    type of splint or support.</h4><br>

                <h1>Supporting a Sprain</h1>
                <p>A sprain is a type of injury that occurs when a ligament (a strong, fibrous band of tissue that
                    connects bones to each other) is stretched or torn. Sprains can occur in any joint in the body, but
                    they are most common in the ankles, wrists, and knees.</p><br>
                <p>Sprains can be extremely painful and debilitating, that's why it's important to support them
                    properly. Some methods of supporting a sprain include using splints, crutches, specialized
                    orthopedic braces and often, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medications. An important part of the
                    recovery process is rest, which allows the body to focus energy on the healing process, while
                    keeping the joint immobilized as much as possible. Keeping the area elevated and bandaged, as well
                    as gentle exercise once the area is healed, are also important elements of recovery. A healthcare
                    provider should always be consulted if serious pain or swelling persists. Taking proper steps to
                    heal and support a sprain can help to ensure that damage does not progress and the recovery process
                    can be successful.</p><br>
                <h4>To support a sprain, you can try the following:</h4><br>
                <ol>
                    <li>Rest the injured joint as much as possible. Avoid putting weight on it or using it excessively.
                    </li>
                    <li>Apply ice to the affected area for 15-20 minutes at a time, several times a day. This will help
                        reduce swelling and pain.</li>
                    <li>Elevate the injured limb above the level of your heart to help reduce swelling.</li>
                    <li>Use a compression bandage to help stabilize the joint and reduce swelling.</li>
                    <li>Over-the-counter pain medications, such as acetaminophen or ibuprofen, can help reduce pain and
                        inflammation.</li>
                </ol><br>
                <h4><span>NOTE:</span>It is important to see a doctor if you suspect you have a
                    sprain, as it is possible to have a more serious injury, such as a fracture. The doctor will be able
                    to diagnose the injury and recommend the most appropriate treatment.</h4><br>

                <h1>Stop the Bleeding</h1><br>
                <p>Stopping the bleeding requires the application of steady pressure to the wound, so to effectively
                    reduce the blood flow. The pressure needs to be maintained for a few minutes at a minimum, when
                    applying a clean cloth or sterile gauze will help stop the flow. Additionally, elevating the wound
                    can also help to reduce the blood flow, helping to close the wound. Ultimately, it is key to act
                    quickly and accurately in order stop the bleeding and prevent further complications arising from the
                    wound.</p><br>
                <h4>Stopping bleeding, or hemostasis, is the process of preventing or stopping blood loss from a damaged
                    blood vessel. There are several ways to stop bleeding, including:</h4><br>
                <ol>
                    <li>Apply direct pressure to the wound using a clean cloth or bandage.</li>
                    <li>Elevate the wound above the heart, if possible.</li>
                    <li>Apply a cold compress to the wound to reduce blood flow and swelling.</li>
                    <li>If the bleeding is severe or does not stop with direct pressure, seek medical attention
                        immediately.</li>
                </ol><br>
                <h4>To apply direct pressure to a wound:</h4><br>
                <ol>
                    <li>Clean the wound with soap and water or a wound cleaner, if available.</li>
                    <li>Cover the wound with a sterile gauze pad or clean cloth.</li>
                    <li>Hold the pad or cloth firmly in place with your hand or a bandage.</li>
                    <li>If the bleeding does not stop or slows down but then starts up again, do not remove the pad or
                        cloth. Instead, add more gauze or cloth on top of the original dressing.</li>
                    <li>If the bleeding is severe, do not try to remove the pad or cloth as this may cause the bleeding
                        to start again. Seek medical attention immediately.</li>
                </ol><br>
                <h4><span>NOTE:</span>It is important to follow proper first aid techniques when
                    trying to stop bleeding, as improper treatment can cause further injury. If you are not sure how to
                    properly treat a wound, it is always best to seek medical attention.</h4><br>

                <h1>Building a Fire</h1>
                <p>Building a fire is a great skill to have, as it can provide warmth, light, and even food for survival
                    in emergency situations. This process requires a fire source and fuel, as well as knowledge of how
                    to stack and light the fuel in a way that allows it to burn steadily. With the right supplies and
                    proper safety guidelines, anyone can learn to build a fire.</p><br>
                <h4>Building a fire can be a useful skill in many different situations, such as camping, cooking, or
                    providing warmth and light in an emergency. Here are the basic steps for building a fire:</h4>
                <ol>
                    <li>Gather materials: To build a fire, you will need tinder (small, dry twigs and leaves), kindling
                        (smaller sticks and branches), and larger logs.</li><br>
                    <li>Clear a space: Find a clear, open space away from flammable materials where you can safely build
                        a fire. If you are in a designated fire pit, clear any debris from the area. If you are building
                        a fire outside of a designated fire pit, clear a circle of at least 10 feet in diameter and dig
                        a shallow pit.</li><br>
                    <li>Build a foundation: Place your tinder in the center of the cleared space. On top of the tinder,
                        add a small amount of kindling in a teepee shape, leaving space in the center for air
                        circulation.</li><br>
                    <li>Start the fire: Ignite the tinder using a match, lighter, or other ignition source. As the fire
                        catches, carefully add more kindling to the fire, gradually increasing the size of the sticks as
                        the fire grows.</li><br>
                    <li>Add logs: Once the fire is established, you can add larger logs to keep it going. Add logs
                        gradually, allowing time for the fire to adjust to the additional fuel.</li><br>
                </ol>
                <h4><span>NOTE:</span>Remember to always be careful when building a fire, and never
                    leave a fire unattended. When you are finished with the fire, be sure to extinguish it completely to
                    prevent the risk of wildfire.</h4>

                <h1>First Aid Kit</h1>
                <p>A first aid kit is a collection of supplies and equipment that is used to give medical treatment.
                    There are many different types of first aid kits, ranging from small, personal kits that you can
                    carry with you to larger kits that are designed for use in a workplace or other public setting. Some
                    common items found in a first aid kit include bandages, adhesive tape, scissors, tweezers, gauze,
                    and antiseptic wipes.</p><br>
                <h4>To apply first aid using a kit, follow these steps:</h4>
                <ol>
                    <li>Assess the situation and determine the appropriate course of action.</li><br>
                    <li>Follow any specific instructions provided with the kit or by a medical professional.</li><br>
                    <li>Use the supplies in the kit to treat the injury or illness. This may involve cleaning a wound,
                        applying bandages or other dressings, administering medications, or providing other forms of
                        treatment as needed.</li><br>
                    <li>If the person's condition is serious or life-threatening, call for emergency medical assistance
                        immediately.</li><br>
                </ol>
                <h4><span>NOTE:</span>It is important to note that first aid kits are meant to
                    provide basic medical treatment in an emergency situation. They are not a substitute for
                    professional medical care. If you are unsure about how to use the supplies in a first aid kit, or if
                    you have any questions about the person's condition, it is important to seek medical assistance as
                    soon as possible.</h4>

                <h1>Foraging for Food</h1>
                <p>Foraging is the act of searching for and gathering food from the wild. This can include finding
                    plants, fruits, nuts, and insects to eat. Foraging can be a useful skill to have in survival
                    situations or in areas where access to grocery stores or other food sources is limited. It can also
                    be a fun and sustainable way to find food in nature. There are many factors to consider when
                    foraging for food, including the safety and edibility of the plants and animals you find, as well as
                    any local laws or regulations regarding foraging. It is important to do research and learn from
                    experienced foragers before attempting to gather food from the wild. </p><br>
                <h4> Here are a few general safety tips for foraging for food:</h4>
                <ol>
                    <li>Only gather plants and other food that you can positively identify as safe to eat. It is
                        important to be able to accurately identify plants and animals before consuming them, as some
                        species can be toxic or poisonous.</li><br>
                    <li>Avoid foraging near areas that may be contaminated, such as roadsides or industrial areas.</li>
                    <br>
                    <li>Don't eat anything that has an unusual appearance, smell, or taste.</li><br>
                    <li>Cook foraged food thoroughly to kill any potential bacteria or parasites.</li><br>
                    <li>Be mindful of local laws and regulations regarding foraging. In some areas, it may be illegal to
                        gather certain plants or animals.</li><br>
                </ol>
                <h4><span>NOTE:</span>Some common plants that are safe to forage and have a long
                    history of being used as food include dandelions, plantains, lambsquarters, and purslane. Nuts such
                    as acorns, chestnuts, and hazelnuts can also be a good food source when foraging. It is always a
                    good idea to do some research and learn from experienced foragers before attempting to gather any
                    food from the wild.</h4>

                <h1>Tying Knots</h1>
                <p>A knot is a method of tying two ends of a rope or other cord-like material together, usually to
                    secure it or to hold it in a specific configuration. Knots can be used for a variety of purposes,
                    such as securing cargo, tying up a boat, climbing a mountain, or hanging something from a hook.
                    There are many different knots that can be used for different purposes, and each has its own
                    specific characteristics and uses.</p><br>
                <p>Knots are often used because they can be easily tied and untied, even after being subjected to a lot
                    of stress or weight. This makes them very useful for situations where the rope or cord needs to be
                    adjusted or removed quickly. Additionally, knots can be used to reduce the amount of friction on a
                    rope, which can be helpful when the rope needs to be pulled through a small opening or when it is
                    under a lot of tension.</p><br>
                <p>Overall, knots are a very useful and versatile tool that can be used in many different situations.
                    They are an essential skill for anyone who works with ropes or cord-like materials, and knowing how
                    to tie various knots can be very helpful in a variety of situations.</p><br>

                    tying up a boat, or climbing a mountain. Some common knots include the square knot, the fisherman's
                    knot, and the bowline knot.</h4><br>
                <h4>To tie a square knot, also known as a reef knot, follow these steps:</h4>
                <ol>
                    <li>Take the left end of the rope in your left hand and the right end of the rope in your right
                        hand.</li>
                    <li>Tie a simple overhand knot by bringing the right end over the left end and tucking it under.
                    </li>
                    <li>Bring the left end over the right end and tuck it under, completing the square knot.</li><br>
                </ol>
                <h4>To tie a fisherman's knot, also known as a water knot or double overhand knot, follow these steps:
                </h4>
                <ol>
                    <li>Take the left end of the rope in your left hand and the right end of the rope in your right
                        hand.</li>
                    <li>Tie an overhand knot with the left end, taking it over the right end and tucking it under.</li>
                    <li>Tie another overhand knot with the right end, taking it over the left end and tucking it under.
                    </li>
                    <li>Pull the knots tight against each other to secure the fisherman's knot.</li><br>
                </ol>
                <h4>To tie a bowline knot, follow these steps:</h4>
                <ol>
                    <li>Make a loop in the rope, with the working end on the left and the standing end on the right.
                    </li>
                    <li>Bring the working end up through the loop from the bottom, then over the top and down through
                        the loop again.</li>
                    <li>Pull the working end tight to create a secure knot.</li><br>
