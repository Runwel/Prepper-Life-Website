            <h1>Survival Guides</h1>
            <p>Before we go to the actual topic, can you guess the most priority for survival? Incase you got into
                scenario where you are stranded on an island, what are you going to do first? These infoâ€™s might help
                you to answer those questions.
            </p>
            <h3>Shelter</h3>
            <p>A person can die from exposure in as little as three hours. You must learn how to stay warm when it is
                cold, how to stay cool when it is hot, and how to stay dry when it is wet. Enter the wilderness survival
                shelter. It can take many forms, with a classic one being the debris hut. The debris hut is a small, one
                person shelter that is basically a simple structure that cocoons a person in leaves, grasses, boughs, or
                other natural debris to keep them insulated. It is built to shed water. Just imagine a primitive tent
                and sleeping bag all in one.<br>Regardless of what it looks like, a wilderness survival shelter should
                embrace these essential principles. It should provide insulation and protection from all elements. It
                should include a heart source, whether that is a fire, the sun, or trapping body heat. It should be
                placed in a good location - think high and dry. And lastly, it should offer comfort and sanctuary. After
                all, this will be your new home.</p><br>
            <h3>Water</h3>
            <p>Staying hydrated is also a major survival priority. A person can die from dehydration in just three days.
                Consider that you'll be unconscious by the time you are just 7% dehydrated. Ouch.<br><br>First you'll
                need to find water. Water flows downhill, encourages vegetation, and collects in natural caches, be they
                ponds, lakes, rivers, springs, rock depressions, or even leaves. Unfortunately, most fresh water sources
                are not pure enough to drink from (as they used to be), so you'll need to know how to purify water under
                most situations. Use any of these methods to collect clean, purified water:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>You can get clean, purified water from the inside of plants like grasses, thistles, cactuses, or
                    grapevines. You can also tap many broad leaved trees and collect their sap.</li>
                <li>Collect dew by using a handkerchief or bundle of dry grasses to soak up morning dew, then just wring
                    it out.</li>
                <li>Use a solar still.</li>
            </ul><br>

                    <h3>Fire</h3>
                    <p>Most everyone loves fire. Fire is essential in a wilderness survival situation for a few reasons.
                        One, it provides warmth which keeps body temperature up. Two, it provides heat used to purify
                        water. It also provides light, heat to cook food, and serves as a center to draw people in.
                        Earth based wisdom teaches us that fire is a spirit unto itself, and encourages us to have a
                        good relationship with fire. I know that despite my passion for it, I didn't truly appreciate
                        fire until it took me four days to get it with a fully primitive bow and drill fire making kit
                        on my first wilderness survival solo.
                    </p><br>
                    <h4>There are a variety of skills to learn when it comes to fire:</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Building a fire pit
                        </li>
                        <li>Building a fire reflector
                        </li>
                        <li>Fuels
                        </li>
                        <li>Fire structures</li>

            <h3>Matches</h3>
            <p>While most people assume that they know the proper way to light a match, it never ceases to amaze me how
                many people don't. Try this - test yourself to build and light a fire in just five minutes using only
                one match. Can you do it in a nearby forest? Try out different habitats. How about in the snow? In the
                rain?</p>

                    <h3>Food</h3>
                    <p>On average, we humans can go about three weeks without food, so this tends to be last on the
                        wilderness survival priority list in most situations. As a wilderness survival guide, I
                        encourage my students to connect with their hunter-gatherer ancestors. The reality is that the
                        majority of our time on Earth, we humans have lived as hunter-gatherers. It is deep in our
                        DNA.<br><br>Like our earth based hunter-gatherer ancestors, a good survivalist has a
                        relationship with a wide variety of diverse species that can all serve as foods, depending on
                        the season and location. Take a look at this wilderness survival food list to learn more.</p>

                    <h3>Wilderness Survival Food List</h3> An essential element of wilderness
                    survival is knowing what to eat so you can keep yourself alive. We've got the top 133 wild foods for
                    your survival food list right here.Wild edible plants is a huge area of study unto itself. So much
                    so that it goes beyond the scope of this page of our wilderness survival guide. We have devoted an
                    entire section of our website to this study. Take a look here:<br><br>
                    Discover Edible Wild Plants! 33 most common wild edible plants in N. America. Identification,
                    ethical harvesting, processing, and eating(!) are all a part of the wild edibles experience.<br><br>
                    Hunting, fishing, and trapping are also significant endeavors, ones that take much time and
                    practice. These are also skills that are often times unnecessary in a short term survival situation.
                    However if you are in a wilderness survival situation for any length of time, you'll want these
                    skills. Throwing sticks, bow and arrow, primitive fishing, spear fishing, and primitive trapping are
                    all important to learn.

                    <p>If you do get hurt or sick, it is important to have a solid understanding of medicinal plants and
                        herbal remedies. This area of study also spills outside the bounds of this page of our
                        wilderness survival guide. Here too, we have also devoted an entire section of our website to
                        learning this ancient art: <br><br>
                        Online Herbal Remedies Advice - The Healing Power of Medicinal Plants. This is a guide to herbal
                        remedies that includes an overview, benefits, types, best herbal remedies, and much more.
                        <br><br>
                        This wilderness guide wouldn't be complete without acknowledging this; hands down, skills are
                        much more important than gear when it comes to wilderness survival. You can buy and collect all
                        the best gear in the world, but what happens if you forget it? Or lose it? Or use it up? Then
                        you'll be relying on yourself - your skills. With that said, it is still good to learn about
                        wilderness survival gear and put together a wilderness survival kit. Just don't' depend on it.
